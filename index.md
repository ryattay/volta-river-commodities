This digital history project began in [the national archives in Ghana](https://praad.gov.gh/). Interested in internal trade, I flipped through folders about preventative stations, trading routes, and markets. I continued to come across trade statistics maintained by colonial officials stationed along the Volta River and started to translate the information from paper files into a digital database. For me, the commodity data contained in the records reflects a social and economic history of West African communities connected by the traders who passed through the preventative stations. Volta River Commodities is a website that takes the first step in exploring that history by publishing the commodity database with contextual information.<br/><br/>

Volta River Commodities was built as part of the [Cultural Heritage Informatics initiative](http://chi.anthropology.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University, where I am [a PhD student in the History Department](https://history.msu.edu/people/graduate-students/ryan-carty/).
